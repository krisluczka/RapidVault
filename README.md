# RapidVault

## Relational database management system written in modern C++

This projects aim to create a strong alternative to the currently used databases systems.
The main goals to achieve are:
* Abandoning the SQL for a new query language.
* Switching from statically typed columns to dynamically typed.
* A departure from the current requirement to define relationships.
