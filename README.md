## Relational database management system written in modern C++

This project aims to create a strong alternative to the currently used databases systems with these features:
* Abandoning the SQL for a new query language.
* Switching from statically typed columns to dynamically typed.
* A departure from the current requirement to define relationships.

## Documentation
Currently the documentation is available at https://krisluczka.github.io/RapidVault/.

## Contributing
Since this project is open source, let me know (by creating an issue or pull request etc.) if you:
* found or fix a bug,
* found a new solution that would increase performance or memory management,
* or just found a new idea that would make RapidVault a better database management system.
