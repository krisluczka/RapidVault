## Relational database management system written in modern C++

This projects aim to create a strong alternative to the currently used databases systems.
The main goals to achieve are:
* Abandoning the SQL for a new query language.
* Switching from statically typed columns to dynamically typed.
* A departure from the current requirement to define relationships.

## Documentation
The documentation will use:
* project usage (along with discussing the classes structure and others),
* tutorial on how to port the code to own projects,
* database specifications,
* RVquery language documentation,
* eventual contributors

> [!NOTE]
> The documentation will be published along with the first RapidVault release. 

## Contributing
Since this project is open source, let me know (by creating an issue or pull request etc.) if you:
* found or fix a bug,
* found a new solution that would increase performance or memory management,
* or just found a new idea that would make RapidVault a better database management system.
